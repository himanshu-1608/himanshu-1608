## I'm an Engineer, Mentor and Developer!!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: everything I can
- 🥅 2020 Goals: Gain financial literacy, understand and implement DSA in some of my projects
- 👯 I’m looking forward to work with:
  -  any startups (what I think I'll learn- complete ownership, fast agile deliveries, work on 10 different tech. stack rather than just UI/Backend Dev. or DB/DevOps/Networks Engg.)
  -  any org. that is working on an already developed product (what I think I'll learn- Scalability, reducing Time Complexity OR Product Optimization)
- ❓ Question: **Why the hell DSA is asked in tech. interviews when it is never actually implemented in any company (LinkedLists and Graphs)** (Answer to me on LinkedIn/Email if anybody knows 😕)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I made my startup's co-founders laugh with my memes (in an official presentation :p)
